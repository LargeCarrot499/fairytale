            <h3>Cinderella</h3>
            <p>Once upon a time, there was a rich man's wife who was seriously ill. Before she died, she called her only
                daughter to her side and said, "my dear daughter, my mother will guard you and protect you under the
                nine springs." Then she closed her eyes and died. </p>
            <p>She was buried in the garden. The little girl was a pious and kind girl. She went to her mother's grave
                every day to cry. Winter came, and the snow covered her mother's grave with a white blanket. The spring
                breeze blows, the sun has removed the snow on the grave. When winter goes and spring comes, people move
                across the border, and his father takes another wife. </p>
            <p>The new wife came to settle down with her two daughters. They are beautiful on the outside, but ugly and
                evil inside. When they arrived, it was the beginning of the poor little girl's suffering. They said,
                "what do you want such a useless bucket to do in the hall? Whoever wants to eat the top bag, he has to
                earn it by himself and go to the kitchen to be a kitchen maid." then they took off her beautiful
                clothes, put on her old gray coat, laughed at her playfully, and drove her to the kitchen. She was
                forced to do hard work. Every day before dawn, she got up to carry water, make a fire, cook and wash
                clothes, but also had to endure their sisters' indifference and torture to her. In the evening, when she
                was so exhausted that she had no bed to sleep in, she had to sleep in the ashes by the stove, which
                covered her with ashes, dirty and ugly. For this reason, they called her Cinderella. </p>
            <p>Once, when his father was going to the market, he asked his wife's two daughters what he wanted him to
                bring them back. The first said, "I want beautiful clothes." The second one called, "I want pearls and
                diamonds." He said to his daughter, "what do you want, son?" Cinderella said, "Dear Dad, break me the
                first branch that hit your hat on your way home." When his father came back, he brought back beautiful
                clothes and pearls and diamonds for his first two daughters. On the way, as he passed through a thick
                undergrowth, a branch of a hazel tree hit him, almost sweeping off his hat, so he broke it off and took
                it with him. When he got home, he gave the branch to his daughter. She took the branch to her mother's
                grave and planted it to the grave. She went to the grave to cry three times a day. Every time she cried
                sadly, her tears would constantly drip on the branches and irrigate them, making the branches grow into
                a beautiful tree. Soon, a bird came to build a nest in the tree, and she began to talk with the bird.
                Later, the bird will bring her whatever she wants. </p>
            <p>In order to choose his son's fiancee, the king prepared to hold a three-day grand banquet, and invited
                many beautiful young girls to attend. The prince intends to choose one of these girls to be his bride.
                Cinderella's two sisters were also invited to attend. They called her in and said, "now let's comb our
                hair, polish our shoes, fasten our belts, and we're going to the king's ball." After dressing them up as
                they asked, she couldn't help crying because she wanted to go to the ball herself. She begged her
                stepmother to let her go, but the stepmother said, "Oh, Cinderella, you want to go? What are you going
                to wear? You don't even have a dress, you can't even dance. What kind of dance do you want to go to?"
                Cinderella kept pleading. In order to get rid of her obsession, the stepmother finally said, "I'll pour
                this bowl of peas into the ash heap, if you take it in two hours They're all picked out and you can go
                to the party. " With that, she poured a bowl of peas into the ashes and left. Cinderella had no choice
                but to run out of the back door to the garden and yelled: "pigeons and turtledoves flying across the
                sky, fly here! Fly here! Happy bird friends, come on! Fly here! Everybody, come and help me and pick out
                the peas in the ash </p>
            <p>Now, all the family are gone, and Cinderella is left to sit alone under the hazel tree and cry: "hazel
                tree! Please help me, please shake it, shake off the gold and silver dress for me." </p>
            <p>Her friend bird flew out of the tree and brought her a gold and silver dress and a pair of bright silk
                dancing shoes. After getting dressed and dressed, Cinderella came to the dance hall after her two
                sisters. She looks so elegant, beautiful, beautiful and moving after wearing the luxurious dress. They
                didn't recognize her. They thought she must be a strange princess. They didn't think she was Cinderella.
                They thought Cinderella was still in the ashes at home. </p>
            <p>When the prince saw her, he quickly came to her, held out his hand and asked her to dance. He never
                danced with other girls any more, and his hand would never let her go. Whenever someone asked her to
                dance, the prince always said, "this lady is dancing with me." They danced late together, and she
                remembered that she was going home. The Prince wanted to know where the beautiful girl lived, so he
                said, "I'll take you home." Cinderella agreed on the surface, but when he was not paying attention,
                Cinderella slipped away and ran home. The prince was after him, so she jumped into the pigeon room and
                shut the door. The prince waited outside and refused to leave until her father came home when he came to
                tell him that the unknown girl he met at the dance had hidden in the pigeon room. When they broke open
                the door of the pigeon house, it was empty inside. He had to go back to the palace in disappointment.
                When her parents came into the house, Cinderella was already lying on the edge of the ash pile in her
                dirty clothes, as if she had been lying there all the time. The dim little oil lamp was shaking in the
                hole in the wall of the chimney post. As a matter of fact, Cinderella just walked through the pigeon
                house and came to the hazel tree. She took off her beautiful dress, put them back on the tree and let
                the birds take them away. She went back to the house and sat on the ash heap and put on her gray coat.
            </p>
            <p>The next day, when the ball was about to begin, her father, stepmother and two sisters all went.
                Cinderella came to the tree and said, "hazel tree, please help me. Please shake it and shake off the
                gold and silver dress for me." </p>
            <p>The bird came and brought a more beautiful dress than the one she had worn the day before. When she came
                to the ball hall, her beauty surprised everyone. The prince, who had been waiting for her arrival,
                immediately took her hand and asked her to dance. Whenever someone asked her to dance, he always said,
                as the day before, "this lady is dancing with me." When she was going home in the middle of the night,
                the prince followed her as before, thinking that he could see which house she had entered. But she got
                rid of him and immediately jumped into the garden behind her father's house. There is a beautiful big
                pear tree in the garden. It is full of ripe pears. Cinderella didn't know where to hide, so she had to
                climb up the tree. The prince didn't see her. He didn't know where she had gone. He had to wait until
                her father came back, and then he went up to him and said, "the nameless girl who danced with me has
                slipped away. I think she must have jumped up the pear tree." Father thought to himself, "is it
                Cinderella?" so he asked someone to bring an ax and cut down the tree. There was no one on the tree.
                When her father and stepmother came to the kitchen to see her, Cinderella was lying in the ashes as
                usual. It turned out that after she jumped onto the pear tree, she slipped down from the other side of
                the tree, took off her beautiful dress and let the birds on the hazel tree take it back. Then she put on
                her own little gray coat. </p>
            <p>On the third day, when her father, stepmother and two sisters had left, she came back to the garden and
                said, "hazel tree, please help me. Please shake it and shake off the gold and silver dress for me." </p>
            <p>The prince picked up the shoes and the next day came to his father, the king, and said, "I want to marry
                the girl who happens to be able to wear this golden slipper as my wife." Cinderella's two sisters were
                very happy when they heard the news, because they both had beautiful feet. They thought that they had no
                doubt to put on the dancing shoes. My sister was accompanied by her mother to the house to try on the
                dance shoes, but her big toe couldn't fit in. The shoe was too small for her. So her mother gave her a
                knife and said, "it doesn't matter. Cut off the big toe! As long as you're queen, you don't need to use
                your feet where you want to go." Hearing this, the eldest daughter felt that it was reasonable. The
                silly girl cut off her big toe in pain, and reluctantly put it on her foot and came to the prince's
                face. When the prince saw that she had put on her shoes, he took her as a bride, rode side by side with
                her and took her away. </p>
            <p>But on their way back to the palace, when they passed the hazel tree planted by Cinderella in the back
                garden, a little pigeon on the branch sang, "go back! Go back again! Look at that shoe! The shoes are
                too small for her! Prince! Prince! Look for your bride again. It's not your bride who is sitting beside
                you“ </p>
            <p>When the prince heard this, he got off the horse and looked at her feet. He found that the blood was
                flowing out of the shoes. He knew that he had been cheated. He turned the horse's head and took the fake
                bride back to her home and said, "this is not the real bride. Let another sister try this shoe." So my
                sister tried to put the shoes on her feet. She went in front of her feet, but her heel was too big to
                fit in. Her mother told her to cut off her heel and put it in. Then she pulled her to the prince. When
                the prince saw that she had put on her shoes, he took her on his horse as a bride and sat side by side
                and left. </p>
            <p>But when they passed the hazel tree, the little pigeon still perched on the top of the branch, and it
                sang, "go back again! Go back again! Look at that shoe that is too small for her! Prince! Prince! Look
                for your bride again. It is not your bride who is sitting beside you“ </p>
            <p>When the prince looked down, he found that the blood was flowing out of the dance shoes, even her white
                stockings were red. He turned the horse's head and sent her back. He said to her father, "this is not
                the real bride. Do you have any daughters?" the father replied, "no, there is only a dirty little girl
                named Cinderella born to my ex-wife. She can't be the bride's However, the prince insisted that he bring
                her to have a try. Cinderella washed her face and hands. Then she came in and bowed to the prince with
                civility. The prince gave her dancing shoes to wear, and they were worn on her feet as if they were
                specially made for her. He went up to look at her face carefully, recognized her, and immediately said
                excitedly, "this is my real bride." The stepmother and her two sisters were shocked. When the prince
                lifted Cinderella onto the horse, they turned pale with anger and watched the prince take her away. When
                they came to the hazel tree, the little white dove sang, "go home! Go home! Look at that shoe! Princess!
                These shoes are made for you! Prince! Prince! Take the bride home. The real bride is sitting beside you“
            </p>
            <p>After singing, the dove comes up and stops on Cinderella's right shoulder. They went to the palace
                together. </p>
            <p>Cinderella's story conveys to us such a process of life experience - under any ridicule, difficulties and
                bullying, we should bear hardships and stand hard and live with humiliation. Even in extreme hardship,
                as long as we have unlimited vision for a better future and maintain a kind and positive attitude, we
                will eventually have a happy life. These principles can be seen from the practice of "Cinderella"
                phenomenon for thousands of years. However, just as there will be a thousand Hamlets in the eyes of a
                thousand people, we can see more things from Cinderella's fairy tale: punctuality, personal appearance,
                maternal love, friendship and the importance of self love. </p>
